A first go at building a full-fletched website from scratch in The Odin Project online coding course. 

My hope is to learn how to independently set up a website without the help of 3rd party website builder software.

Skills developed include:
- Create and clone a git repository with github
- Edit a README
- Keep organized folders of HTML files on my local machine
- Push files to github with concise and descriptive commit messages
- Create HTML files with proper boilerplate and headings
- Embed images with descriptive alt text
- Create ordered and unordered lists
